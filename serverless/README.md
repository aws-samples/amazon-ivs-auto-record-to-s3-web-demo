# Amazon IVS Auto-record to Amazon S3 serverless installation instructions

This file includes instructions for installing the Amazon IVS Auto-record to S3 web demo serverless infrastructure. The serverless infrastructure runs the backend code for this demo and is deployed using an AWS CloudFormation template: [r2s3-serverless.yaml](./r2s3-serverless.yaml).

You can view the source code for the template in `./lambda`, but to make deployable changes, you will need to update the `r2s3-serverless.yaml` CloudFormation template file.

There are two methods you can use to deploy this app:
- [Use a command-line tool (AWS CLI or AWS Cloudshell)](#use-the-cli-or-cloudshell)
- [Use the AWS web console](#use-the-aws-web-console)


## Use the CLI or Cloudshell
These are instructions for using the command-line (AWS CLI tool or AWS Cloudshell) to deploy this app. We recommend having a text editor handy for making changes to commands and keeping track of the commands you need to run.

### 1. Create an Amazon S3 bucket
First, create an Amazon S3 bucket to upload the template file. Your S3 bucket name must be all lowercase characters or numbers, and unique across all of Amazon S3. Use dashes `-` or underscores `_` instead of spaces. More information is available in the [naming rules](#amazon-s3-bucket-naming-rules) section.

To create the bucket, execute the following command:

```console
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket <my-bucket-name> --region <my-region> --create-bucket-configuration LocationConstraint=<my-region>
```

- Replace `<my-bucket-name>` with the name you chose for your bucket.
- Replace `<my-region>` with the **AWS Region** where you want the bucket to reside. An example of an AWS region is: `us-west-2`.

### 2. Upload the CloudFormation Template to the S3 Bucket
Navigate to the `amazon-ivs-auto-record-to-s3-web-demo/serverless` folder and run the following command. Make sure to replace `<my-bucket-name>` with the name of the S3 bucket you created.

```console
aws s3 cp ./r2s3-serverless.yaml s3://<my-bucket-name>/
```

### 3. Deploy the Template Using CloudFormation
Execute the following command to deploy the serverless backend. Make sure to replace the following items:

- Replace `<title>` with the title for your channel.
- Replace `<subtitle>` with the subtitle for your channel.
- Replace `<my-region>` with the AWS Region where your bucket resides.
- Replace `<my-bucket-name>` with the name of the S3 bucket you created.

```console
aws cloudformation deploy \
   --s3-bucket <my-bucket-name> \
   --template-file r2s3-serverless.yaml \
   --stack-name IVS-R2S3 \
   --parameter-overrides Title=<title> \ Subtitle=<subtitle> \
   --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM \
   --region=<my-region>
```

### 4. Take note of the stack outputs
Execute the following command to see the outputs of the CloudFormation stack.

```console
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name "IVS-R2S3"
```

The command will return a set of information about the stack, including the output keys and values. You may need some of the following values to finish run the included [client app](../web-ui).

- ApiGatewayStageUrl
- IvsChannelArn
- IvsStorageBucketName
- IvsStreamKey
- IvsChannelIngestEndpointOutput

### 5. Configure the client application
Now that the serverless app is deployed, set up the [client app](../web-ui) included in the `web-ui` folder of this repository.

**Important CloudFront information:**
Given the distributed nature of the CloudFront distribution used in the serverless backend, you may get 404 errors if you try to use it before CloudFront has completed its propagation to all EDGE locations. If you are experiencing errors with the application, wait a least an hour before you try to use the web-ui client on a new stack.

## Use the AWS Web Console
### 1. Create an Amazon S3 bucket
Complete the following steps to create an Amazon S3 bucket:
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amazon S3 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).
2. Choose **Create bucket**. The Create bucket wizard will open.
3. In Bucket name, enter a name for your bucket.
4. In Region, choose the AWS Region where you want your bucket to reside.
5. In Bucket settings for Block Public Access, choose the **Block Public Access** settings that you want to apply to the bucket. As a best practice, it is recommended to block _all_ public access.

When you finish, choose **Create bucket** to create the bucket.

### 2. Upload the CloudFormation Template to the S3 Bucket
Complete the following steps to upload the CloudFormation template to your S3 bucket.
1. In the Buckets list, choose the bucket you created in the previous step.
2. Choose **Upload**.
3. In the Upload window, select and upload the `r2s3-serverless.yaml` file from the `serverless` folder. You can also drag and drop the file on the browser window
4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and choose **Upload**.

### 3. Deploy the template using AWS CloudFormation
Complete the following steps to deploy the serverless backend:
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amazon CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).
2. Create a new stack by using one of the following options:
   - Choose **Create Stack**. *This is the only option if you have a currently running stack.*
   - Choose **Create Stack** on the Stacks page. *This option is visible only if you have no running stacks.*
   ![CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/images/console-create-stack-stacks-create-stack.png)
3. On the Specify template page, choose a stack template selecting the **Template is ready** option.
4. Select the **Upload a template file** option.
5. Click on the **Choose file** button and upload the `r2s3-serverless.yaml` template from the `serverless` folder.
6. Click **Next**.
   - In the **Stack name** field, enter **IVS-R2S3**.
   - In the **Title** field, enter a title for your channel.
   - In the **Subtitle** field, enter a subtitle for your channel.
7. Click **Next** to advance to the **Configure Stack Options / Advanced Options page**, then click **Next** again to advance to the **Review "Stackname" page**.
8. Review the settings and use the **Edit** button to make any changes you want to make.
9. Scroll to the bottom of the page and select all of the checkboxes in the **Capabilities and Transforms** section.
10. Click on **Create stack** to finalize the settings and create the stack. You will see the **Stack Details page**, and the **Events / Status field** will display the progress of the stack creation process.

Once the stack creation process is complete, the **Events report** will list all of the creation events and their status.

### 4. Take note of the stack outputs
Once your stack is finished creating, click the **Outputs** tab. You may need some of the following values to finish run the included [client app](../web-ui).
- ApiGatewayStageUrl
- IvsChannelArn
- IvsStorageBucketName
- IvsStreamKey
- IvsChannelIngestEndpointOutput

### 5. Configure the client application
Now that the serverless app is deployed, set up the [client app](../web-ui) included in the `web-ui` folder of this repository.

**Important CloudFront information:**
Given the distributed nature of the CloudFront distribution used in the serverless backend, you may get 404 errors if you try to use it before CloudFront has completed its propagation to all EDGE locations. If you are experiencing errors with the application, wait a least an hour before you try to use the web-ui client on a new stack.

# Application Removal and Cleanup.
The application uses a small amount of AWS resources even when not in active use. If you wish to uninstall the software to prevent ongoing AWS charges or just to clean up your AWS account, just follow these steps to remove the installed components.

## Empty the S3 Bucket created by CloudFormation for the IVS software.
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [S3 Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/).
2. Select the bucket for the IVS software. (The bucket name is also viewable as the value of **IVSStorageBucketName** shown in Step 2, "...Outputs of the CloudFormation Stack".)
3. Click on the **Empty** button, type "**permanently delete**" in the confirmation textbox and then click on the **Empty** button again.

## Delete the IVS software's CloudFormation Stack.
1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amazon CloudFormation console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).
2. Select the stack you created in step # (default name **IVS-R2S3**).
3. Click on the "Delete" button.
4. Click on the "Delete stack" button.

## Delete the Recording Configuration.
1. After you have deleted the CloudFormation stack, sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the [Amazon IVS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ivs/channels).
2. Click on the **Recording configurations** section.
3. Select the recording configuration that you created on step #4.
4. Click on the **Delete** button.
   - Type **Delete** in the confirmation textbox.
   - Click on the **Delete** button.

That's it! You have successfully removed all of the IVS R2S3 software components from your AWS account.
